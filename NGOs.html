        <h2><a href="https://www.karmafoundation.ngo/">KARMA FOUNDATION</a></h2>
        <p>We, at Karma Foundation truly believe that animals are the real victims on earth. They didn't declare war, they don't have weapons and they don't want to destroy humans or impose their religion. Their only “crime” is that they exist. Keeping the ever rising cases of accidents, cruelty, starvation, illnesses and so on, we have built an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Operation Theatre (OT) & Out Patient Department (OPD) for such animals who suffer each day on the streets of the city.</p>
